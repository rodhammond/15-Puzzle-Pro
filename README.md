## 🕹️ Game Play

The **15 puzzle** (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and more) is a **sliding** puzzle. It has 15 square tiles numbered 1 to 15 in a frame that is 4 tile positions high and 4 tile positions wide, with one unoccupied position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order (from left to right, top to bottom).

## 🏛️ Historical Context

### Origins of the Challenge
The **15-Puzzle** was invented circa **1874** by **Noyes Palmer Chapman**, a postmaster in Canastota, New York. Chapman originally presented the puzzle to his friends as sixteen numbered blocks in a 4x4 grid. By 1880, it became an international phenomenon, often referred to as the "Gem Puzzle."

### The Sam Loyd Controversy
The puzzle's worldwide fame is inextricably linked to the promotional efforts of **Sam Loyd**, a famous American chess player. Loyd falsely claimed for decades that he was the original inventor. He famously offered a $1,000 prize for solving a configuration starting with the "14-15" tiles swapped. This challenge was a clever marketing ploy: it was mathematically impossible to solve, as sliding moves preserve the parity of the permutation.

## 📈 Sliding Tile Grouping Theory

*Refined from [Wikipedia: 15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)*

The transformations of the 15 puzzle form a **groupoid** (not a group, as not all moves can be composed);<sup>[12][13][14]</sup> this groupoid acts on configurations.

Because the combinations of the 15 puzzle can be generated by 3-cycles, it can be proved that the 15 puzzle can be represented by the **alternating group $A_{15}$**.<sup>[15]</sup> In fact, any $2k-1$ sliding puzzle with square tiles of equal size can be represented by **$A_{2k-1}$**.

For the 15 puzzle, lengths of optimal solutions range from 0 to 80 single-tile moves (there are 17 configurations requiring 80 moves)<sup>[4][5]</sup> or 43 multi-tile moves;<sup>[6]</sup> the 8 Puzzle always can be solved in no more than 31 single-tile moves or 24 multi-tile moves (integer sequence A087725). The multi-tile metric counts subsequent moves of the empty tile in the same direction as one.<sup>[6]</sup>

The number of possible positions of the 24 puzzle is $\frac{25!}{2} \approx 7.76 \times 10^{24}$, which is too many to calculate God's number feasibly using brute-force methods. In 2011, lower bounds of 152 single-tile moves or 41 multi-tile moves had been established, as well as upper bounds of 208 single-tile moves or 109 multi-tile moves.<sup>[7][8][9][10]</sup> In 2016, the upper bound was improved to 205 single-tile moves.<sup>[11]</sup>

## 🧠 Logic Search Engines & AI Advisor

### 🧮 Math Algorithm Engines
This game includes algorithm search engines which navigate a search space of approximately **10.46 trillion** reachable states ($16! / 2$) to present the player with auto-solving help options. Four powerful search engines have been implemented:

| Engine | Tag | Optimal? | Description |
|--------|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Supreme Navigator** | GRANDMASTER | Yes | IDA* with iterative deepening. Memory efficient, guaranteed optimal. |
| **Dual Convergence** | MEET-IN-MIDDLE | Yes | Bidirectional A* searching from both start and goal. Dramatically faster for complex puzzles. |
| **Tactical Analysis** | RELIABLE | Near | Weighted A* for shallow to medium shuffles. |
| **Instant Velocity** | HIGH VELOCITY | No | Greedy best-first search. Prioritizes speed over optimality. |

**Heuristics**: All engines use **Manhattan Distance** combined with **Linear Conflict** detection to prune trillions of sub-optimal paths.

### 🔑 AI Strategic Advisor
Provides real-time tactical insights with a hybrid hint system:

- **Algorithmic Hints (Default)**: Works out of the box with no setup required. Analyzes puzzle state using Manhattan distance, quadrant analysis, and solver data to generate contextual advice.
- **AI-Powered Hints (Optional)**: Enhanced hints using Google's Gemini models. Add your own free API key via the in-app settings button.
- **Privacy**: No API keys are stored in source code. User keys are stored locally in browser storage only.

## 🚀 Deployment & Security

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rodhammond/15-Puzzle-Pro.git
    cd 15-Puzzle-Pro
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Local Development**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Opens at `http://localhost:3000`

4.  **Production Build & Deploy**:
    ```bash
    npm run build    # Build for production
    npm run deploy   # Deploy to GitHub Pages
    ```

### Environment Configuration (Optional)
For AI-powered hints during build, create a `.env` file:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```
**Note**: This is optional! The game works fully without it using algorithmic hints. Users can also add their own API key directly in the app via the settings button.

### Usage Instructions
- Click **START** to engage the system and begin a new session.
- Use the **Manual Configuration** preset to test specific states or custom goals.
- Once a solution is calculated, use the **Logic Stream Visualizer** to scroll through the historical path of the solution.
- Click the **AI key icon** to optionally add your Gemini API key for enhanced hints.
